# SeattleEnergy

## Presentation

In this project, we are working for the city of Seattle and with its open data. The goal is to facilitate the building energy statement generation for the non-residential buildings.

Complex and complete energy statements have been made by the city, but they represent a big effort and our task is to simplify the process using our Data Science skills.

In this project, we have multiple objectives:
* Predict the energy consumption and green house gas emissions of the buildings,
* Investigate the EnergyStar score and determinate if it is relevant for the greenhouse gas emissions predictions.

In order to fullfill these objectives:
* We are going to implement custom Sklearn transformers to create a pipeline for our data.
* Then, we train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to select the best estimator for our problematic.
